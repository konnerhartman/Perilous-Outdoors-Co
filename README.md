  ## Description
  
  Hello! This project is open to anyone willing to lend a hand. 

  I am wanting to build a MERN stack application to mirror my current [SquareSpace website](https://www.perilousoutdoors.com/). The site currently has very poor performance on SquareSpace and my primary goal is to improve that and remove it from SquareSpace. I would also like to polish the UI a little more. This is going to be a challenging task as it is an e-commerce site, which is why I am opening this to the help of my fellow devs. This is a great opportunity to practice with the MERN stack and collaborate with others. I unfortunately can not offer any compensation as of now, but you will of course receive full credit for your contributions and will be able to fork this repo to use on your portfolio, GitHub, etc. Please reach out with any questions or to let me know if you'd like to help! Happy coding!
