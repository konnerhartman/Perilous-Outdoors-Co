            <h2>About POCO.</h2>
            <p>Perilous Outdoors Co. all started in 2016 when two friends were backpacking through the Chisos Mountains of West Texas. As warm scattered storms continued to hound Michael and Konner, they grew frustrated with constantly covering and uncovering themselves with rain gear. This is when the very first POCo. idea sprung. We’re creating the very first rain jacket with an integrated pack cover built into the back of the jacket. This will allow you to hike right into the rain and not bat an eye! Our jacket is designed to simply be tossed over yourself and your pack, quick and easy. No wrestling with your heavy backpack to get it off, struggling to stretch the rain cover over your pack, then wrestling to get it back on. This jacket will offer complete protection to you and your pack. And we mean COMPLETE! With our jacket, you won’t have to worry about your shoulder straps or hip belts soaking in water, possibly resulting in water seeping into the actual pack itself. We got those covered as well!</p>
            <p>This patent-pending design is still in the works. But you can help us by supporting POCo. now, in the early stages! All proceeds go towards the production of this jacket and other gear we’re innovating. </p>
